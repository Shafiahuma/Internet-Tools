                                    An algorithm is a set of instructions
                                    for solving a problem or

                                    In computer science, a programmer must employ five <span id="dots3">....</span> <span id="more3">basic parts of an algorithm to create a successful program:

                                    Describe the problem in mathematical terms

                                    Create the formulas and processes that create results

                                    Input the outcome parameters

                                    Execute the program repeatedly to test its accuracy

                                    The conclusion of the algorithm is the result given after the parameters go through the set of instructions in the program.

                                    For financial algorithms, the more complex the program, the more data the software can use to make accurate assessments to buy or sell securities. Programmers test complex algorithms thoroughly to ensure the programs are without errors.Many algorithms can be used for one problem; however, some simplify the process better than others.</span></p>

                                    Scientists and engineers have to make use <span id="dots4">....</span> <span id="more4">of their time wisely. Well-built algorithms help optimize time by finding and programming the quickest path to get something done. For example, Instagram uses an algorithm which determines which posts to show you at the top of your feed, based on your browsing habits. This way, you spend less time looking for posts that you might be interested in. Algorithms can be used to sort a large set of information based on a set of structural rules, such as step by step instructions.For example, usually when you search for something on Google, there are many results, even pages and pages of results. However, more often than not, you never have to venture off that first page of results, because the most important and relevant items are on that first page. This is because of a specific algorithm that Google uses in order to sort through and figure which websites are the most important, based on relevance and website rank. We will go into further depth of this specific algorithm later on.</span></p> <button onclick="myFunctionc()" id="myBtn4">Read more</button>

                                <p>Algorithms are used by both computers and humans <span id="dots5">....</span> <span id="more5">to make interconnected decisions throughout our world. Google's search algorithm sorts through billions of webpages, presenting desired information to you in milliseconds. GPS systems manage massive systems of transport, ride sharing, and shipping. Algorithmic trading executes high-speed decisions to determine optimal investments faster than any human. While these algorithms may sound intimidating,Â all algorithms are essentially detailed sets of instructions that computers follow to arrive at an answer. Humans also constantly utilize (simpler) algorithms: for example, a recipe to make dinner is an algorithm.
                                    For kids, understanding the process of building an algorithm
                                    helps them build a strong foundation in logical thinking and problem solving.</span></p><button onclick="myFunctiond()" id="myBtn5">Read more</button>
