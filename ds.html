                                    <p>For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value (let’s say one of your friends). Here, you can identify the location of any of your friends by simply knowing the count of the step they are on. 
                                        Remember: “Location of next index depends on the data type we use”.</p>

                                    <p>In C language, array has a fixed size meaning once the size is given to it, it cannot be changed i.e. you can’t shrink it neither can you expand it. The reason was that for expanding, if we change the size we can’t be sure ( it’s not possible every time) that we get the next memory location to us as free. The shrinking will not work because the array, when declared, gets memory statically allocated, and thus compiler is the only one can destroy it.</p>

                                    <p>Advantages of using arrays
                                        <br>· Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
                                        <br>· Arrays have better cache locality that makes a pretty big difference in performance.
                                        <br>· Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.</p>

                                    Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable
                                    addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a
                                    <span id="dots13">....</span>
                                    <span id="more13"> specific index. Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element. This difference in the data storage scheme decides which data structure would be more suitable for a given situation. 
                                        Linked list provides the following two advantages over arrays
                                        <br>1) Dynamic size

                                    In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the
