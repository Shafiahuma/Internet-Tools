                                        An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a
                                        collection of objects known as a node where node consists of two parts, i.e.,
                                        data and address. Array elements store in a contiguous memory location. Linked
                                        list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.</p>

                                        Stack is a basic data-structure where insertion and deletion of data takes place
                                        at one end called the top of the stack. ... A stack is always processed in LIFO
                                        manner wherein the element can be added or remove from the top end of the stack.
                                        That is why a stack is also called a LIFO data structure.</p>
